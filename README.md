BINARY CLASSIFICATION OF HUMAN BLOOD CELLS TO DETECT INFECTION WITH MALARIA PARASITE OR OTHERWISE USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (VGG19) AND VISION TRANSFORMER(ViG)

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is preventable and curable. In 2018, there were an estimated 228 million cases of malaria worldwide. The estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 405 000 in 2018. Children aged under 5 years are the most vulnerable group affected by malaria; in 2018, they accounted for 67% (272 000) of all malaria deaths worldwide. The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2018, the region was home to 93% of malaria cases and 94% of malaria deaths.

The WHO African Region continues to carry a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2023 the Region was home to about 94% of all malaria cases and 95% of deaths. Children under 5 years of age accounted for about 76% of all malaria deaths in the Region.

Over half of these deaths occurred in four countries: Nigeria (30.9%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (11.3%), Niger (5.9%) and United Republic of Tanzania (4.3%).

This project focuses on the use of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Computer Vision to create a model that helps to detect malaria parasites in the human body by classifying the blood cells as 'Parasite_infected' or 'uninfected'. This model further underscores the merits that AI brings into the health sector; helping to reduce timetaken to detect malaria. Thus aiding faster treatment and reducing the number of death due to malaria.
